Hi All! \\
\\
Due to limited knowlegde sources I am sailing on uncharted waters.  
Everyday is a great adventure of exploring this wonderfull world of mobile tests automation.
All knowlegde which can be found on this blog is the answer for certain technical and software problems which
I faced during my regular work as a QA. This is why I decided to create this blog. I believe by reading this blog you will find passion and
 togheter we can make mobile automation easier. \\
By now I have a great pleasure to present you this blog as my guide for mobile automation test! \\
\\
You can find the source code for samples of my automated mobile test at GitHub:
