<p>Technically I am graduated Land Surveyor. I worked around 5 years as a surveyor and after every year I was getting less and less happy. 
In some moment one block took my hand and said I don't need to do what I don't like to. And that was a first day I heard about Quality Assurance in software development.
Since this moment It's been some time. I have got ITQB cert, I have learned how to write automated tests in Python and Java. You can find my beginnings on personal <a href="https://github.com/talareq">GitHub!</a> repositories. Also recenly, I have introduced an innovative way of running tests
on mobile device in a company I am currently working in. I have succesfully proved a concept to use Appium framework for mobile testing. For now paralelly to my regular duties I am also focused
on developing my internal project of mobile testing to get the highest possible value in testing our main project.</p>
